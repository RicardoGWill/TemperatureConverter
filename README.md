# TemperatureConverter
This app is one that I created by myself! Of course, I did research on various concepts, but I did not follow any specific tutorial, aside from learning how to format numbers and such.  In other words, this is of my own design.  It is also one of the more complex apps that I have worked on, as it converts temperatures from both Celsius to Fahrenheit, and from Fahrenheit to Celsius, depending on which radio button is selected (or, more accurately, whether one radio button is selected or not).  The input text is converted from a String into a Double, and then it is run through one of two formulae, depending on the radio button.  Then, the result (which is still a Double) is formatted and returned to a String to be shown as text, along with " °F" or " °C", again, depending on the selection.  I am extra proud of myself with this one!
